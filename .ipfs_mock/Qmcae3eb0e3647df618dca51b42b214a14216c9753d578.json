Its all-time high (ATH) was recorded in March 2024 at approximately **$73,750** (depending on the exchange). While many analysts and financial institutions (such as Standard Chartered and Bernstein) have issued price targets of $100,000 or higher for late 2024 or 2025, these remain speculative projections and not historical facts.\n\nBecause the event is set in the future, the resolution for a \"Did it happen\" query must be **NO** (or \"Not yet occurred\").\n\n---\n\n### **",
